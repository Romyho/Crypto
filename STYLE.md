# Style Guide

In this document, 10 main rules were chosen to style my code. The rules will
make the code more clear to read and consistent.

Rules:

+ In D3, Selection and new element are separated.

+ In D3, specify names for block's to make them easier to find and use.

+ In Javascript use camelCase.

+ Column limit: 80

+ In HTML use kebab-case.

+ Make for every function an explanation using comments.

+ All variables have useful names, to make the code easier to read.

+ In Python use snake_case.

+ Use consistent language, either all english or all dutch.

+ Style in css documents not in Javascript.
